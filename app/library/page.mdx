# C++ Library features

All the headers in the C++ Standard Library are available in the `std` namespace. The C++ Standard
Library provides a rich set of functions and classes that can be used to perform various tasks, such as
input/output operations, string manipulation, and mathematical computations. The library is divided into
several components, each serving a specific purpose. Some of the most commonly used components
include:

- **Input/Output Library**: This component provides functions and classes for performing input and output
  operations. It includes the `iostream` library for standard input/output, as well as file handling
  libraries like `fstream` and `cstdio`.
- **String Library**: The string library provides classes and functions for manipulating strings. The
  `std::string` class is a widely used string class that supports various operations such as
  concatenation, substring extraction, and searching.
- **Container Library**: The container library provides a set of classes for storing and managing
  collections of data. It includes various container types such as vectors, lists, sets, and maps. Each
  container type has its own set of functions for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
- **Algorithm Library**: The algorithm library provides a set of functions for performing common
  operations on containers, such as sorting, searching, and transforming data. These functions are
  designed to work with the container classes in the C++ Standard Library.
- **Numerical Library**: The numerical library provides functions for performing mathematical operations,
  such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and random number generation. It includes the `<cmath>`
  library for mathematical functions and the `<random>` library for random number generation.
- **Concurrency Library**: The concurrency library provides support for multi-threading and parallel
  programming. It includes classes and functions for creating and managing threads, as well as
  synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables.

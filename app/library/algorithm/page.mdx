# C++ Algorithm features
#
The C++ Standard Library provides a rich set of algorithms that can be used to perform various operations on
containers. These algorithms are designed to work with the container classes in the C++ Standard
Library and	are implemented as template functions. This allows them to work with any container type that
supports the required operations. The algorithms are divided into several categories, including:
- **Non-modifying algorithms**: These algorithms do not modify the elements in the container. They include
  functions for searching, counting, and checking properties of elements.
- **Modifying algorithms**: These algorithms modify the elements in the container. They include functions
  for sorting, shuffling, and transforming elements.

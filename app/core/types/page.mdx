# C++ Fundamental Types

C++ provides a rich set of fundamental types that are used to represent various kinds of data. These types can be broadly categorized into several groups:
- **Integer Types**: These types are used to represent whole numbers. They can be signed (allowing both positive and negative values) or unsigned (only allowing non-negative values). The standard integer types include:
  - `int`: A signed integer type, typically 4 bytes.
  - `unsigned int`: An unsigned integer type, typically 4 bytes.
  - `short`: A signed short integer type, typically 2 bytes.
  - `unsigned short`: An unsigned short integer type, typically 2 bytes.
  - `long`: A signed long integer type, typically 4 or 8 bytes.
  - `unsigned long`: An unsigned long integer type, typically 4 or 8 bytes.
  - `long long`: A signed long long integer type, typically 8 bytes.
  - `unsigned long long`: An unsigned long long integer type, typically 8 bytes.
- **Floating-Point Types**: These types are used to represent real numbers (numbers with fractional parts). The standard floating-point types include:
  - `float`: A single-precision floating-point type, typically 4 bytes.
  - `double`: A double-precision floating-point type, typically 8 bytes.
  - `long double`: An extended-precision floating-point type, typically 8, 12, or 16 bytes, depending on the implementation.
- **Character Types**: These types are used to represent individual characters. The standard character types include:
  - `char`: A character type, typically 1 byte.
  - `unsigned char`: An unsigned character type, typically 1 byte.
  - `signed char`: A signed character type, typically 1 byte.

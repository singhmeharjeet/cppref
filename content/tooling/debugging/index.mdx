# Debugging C++ Applications
Debugging is an essential part of the software development process, allowing developers to identify
and fix issues in their code. In C++, two popular debugging tools are GDB (GNU Debugger) and LLDB
(LLVM Debugger). This section provides an overview of these tools and their usage.
## GDB (GNU Debugger)
GDB is a powerful debugger for C and C++ programs. It allows you to inspect the state of your
program
while it is running, set breakpoints, and step through your code line by line. GDB can be used
from the command line or integrated into various IDEs.
### Basic GDB Commands	
- `gdb <executable>`: Start GDB with the specified executable.
- `run`: Start the program being debugged.
- `break <line_number>`: Set a breakpoint at the specified line number.


# Debugging in VS code

you need to install the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension provides debugging
support for C and C++ programs.

### Setting Up Debugging in VS Code
1. **Install the C/C++ Extension**: Open the Extensions view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for
   "C/C++". Install the extension provided by Microsoft.
2. **Open Your C++ Project**: Open the folder containing your C++ project in VS Code.
3. **Create a Debug Configuration**: 
   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Debug: Open launch.json".
   - Select "C++ (GDB/LLDB)" as the environment.
   - This will create a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder with a default configuration.
4. **Configure the Debugger**: Modify the `launch.json` file to specify the path to your executable and
   any arguments you want to pass to your program. Here is an example configuration:
   ```json
   {
	   "version": "0.2.0",
	   "configurations": [
		   {
			   "name": "C++ Launch",
			   "type": "cppdbg",
			   "request": "launch",
			   "program": "${workspaceFolder}/path/to/your/executable",
			   "args": [],
			   "stopAtEntry": false,
			   "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
			   "environment": [],
			   "externalConsole": false,
			   "MIMode": "gdb",
			   "setupCommands": [
				   {
					   "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
					   "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
					   "ignoreFailures": true
				   }
			   ],
			   "preLaunchTask": "build"
		   }
	   ]
   }
   ```	
5. **Build Your Project**: Make sure your project is built and the executable is up to date. You can
   use the built-in terminal in VS Code to run your build commands.
6. **Start Debugging**: Press F5 or go to the Run view (Ctrl+Shift+D) and click the green play button
   to start debugging. You can set breakpoints by clicking in the left margin next to the line numbers
   in your source code.
7. **Debugging Controls**: Use the debugging controls in the top bar to step over, step into, or
   continue execution. You can also inspect variables, view the call stack, and evaluate expressions in
   the Debug Console.
8. **Inspect Variables**: Hover over variables in your code to see their current values. You can also
   add variables to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through your code.
9. **Debugging Output**: Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and print output during
   debugging. You can also use the `cout` statement in your code to print debug information to the
   console.
10. **Stop Debugging**: To stop debugging, click the red square button in the top bar or press Shift+F5.
11. **Debugging Tips**: 
	- Use breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code.
	- Step through your code line by line to understand the flow of execution.
	- Inspect variables and data structures to identify issues.
	- Use the Call Stack panel to navigate through function calls and understand the context of your
	  program.

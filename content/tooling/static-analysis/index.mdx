# Static Analysis in C++

Static analysis is the process of analyzing code without executing it. It helps identify potential
issues, bugs, and code quality problems early in the development process. This section covers
various static analysis tools and techniques for C++.
## Static Analysis Tools
### 1. Clang-Tidy
[Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) is a popular static analysis tool for C++
that
provides a wide range of checks for code quality, performance, and style. It is part of the LLVM
project and can be integrated into various IDEs and build systems.
#### Usage
1. Install Clang-Tidy:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install clang-tidy
   ```
2. Run Clang-Tidy on your code:
   ```bash
   clang-tidy my_code.cpp -- -std=c++17
   ```
3. Review the output and fix any reported issues.
### 2. Cppcheck
[Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) is a static analysis tool that focuses on detecting
bugs, undefined behavior, and code style issues in C++ code. It is easy to use and can be integrated
into various IDEs and build systems.
#### Usage
1. Install Cppcheck:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install cppcheck
   ```
2. Run Cppcheck on your code:
   ```bash
   cppcheck my_code.cpp
   ```
3. Review the output and fix any reported issues.
### 3. SonarQube
[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) is a powerful static analysis platform that supports
multiple programming languages, including C++. It provides a web-based interface for analyzing code
quality, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. SonarQube can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
and supports various plugins for additional functionality.
#### Usage
1. Install SonarQube:
   - Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/) for your
	 platform.

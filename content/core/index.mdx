# C++ Core Language features
The C++ Core Language features are the fundamental building blocks of the C++ programming language.
They include basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented
programming concepts. Understanding these features is essential for writing efficient and effective
C++ code.

## Basic Syntax
C++ syntax is similar to C, with some additional features. The basic structure of a C++ program
includes the following components:
- **Preprocessor Directives**: These are commands that are processed before the compilation of the

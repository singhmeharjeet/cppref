# C++ Documentation

This documentation isn't meant to be precise or exhaustive. It is a collection of notes and examples
that can be used as a reference for C++ programming.

The main idea is to provide good examples and explanations of the C++ language features, libraries, and
tools. The documentation is organized into several sections, each covering a specific topic.


```cpp filename="hello.cpp" copy showLineNumbers
#include <print>

auto main() -> int {
	std::println("Hello, World!");
	return 0;
}
```

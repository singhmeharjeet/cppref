# Creating Your First C++ Program: "Hello, World!"

The traditional first program in any programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. This simple program displays the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## The Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Code Explanation

Let's break down this simple program:

1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the Input/Output stream library, which provides functionality for reading from and writing to the console.

2. `int main()`: This declares the main function, which is the entry point of every C++ program. The `int` indicates that the function returns an integer value.

3. `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;`: This line outputs text to the console.
   - `std::cout` is the standard output stream (console output)
   - `<<` is the stream insertion operator
   - `"Hello, World!"` is the string literal we want to display
   - `std::endl` adds a newline character and flushes the output buffer

4. `return 0;`: This returns an exit code of 0 to the operating system, indicating successful execution.

## Compiling and Running

To compile this program:

```bash
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
```

To run the program:

```bash
./hello_world
```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Common Variations

### Using Namespace std

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Without Return Statement

In modern C++, the return 0 statement can be omitted from the main function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    // return 0; is implied
}
```

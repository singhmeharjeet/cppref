# Header Files in C++

Header files are a fundamental part of C++ programming. They contain declarations of functions, classes, and variables that can be included and used in other source files.

## Purpose of Header Files

Header files serve several important purposes:

1. **Code Reusability**: Declare functions, classes, and variables once and use them in multiple source files
2. **Interface Definition**: Separate interface (declarations) from implementation (definitions)
3. **Modular Programming**: Split large programs into smaller, manageable pieces
4. **Precompiled Code**: Include standard library functionality

## Common Standard Headers

C++ provides a rich set of standard headers:

### Input/Output Headers
- `<iostream>`: Standard I/O streams (cin, cout, cerr)
- `<fstream>`: File stream operations
- `<sstream>`: String stream operations
- `<iomanip>`: I/O manipulators for formatting

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
    std::cout << std::setw(10) << std::left << "Value:" << 42 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### String Manipulation Headers
- `<string>`: String class and operations
- `<cstring>`: C-style string functions

## Header File Structure

A typical header file includes:

1. Include Guards (or `#pragma once`)
2. Necessary #include directives
3. Declarations (not definitions)
4. Inline functions (if needed)
5. Templates (if needed)

### Example Header File

```cpp
// MyClass.h
#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass();
    void doSomething();
    
private:
    int m_data;
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H
```

## Best Practices for Header Files

1. **Use include guards** or `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusion
2. **Minimize includes** in header files to reduce compilation time
3. **Forward declare** when possible instead of including headers
4. **Don't include what you don't need**
5. **Prefer .h extension** for your own headers (though .hpp is also common)
6. **Include only declarations**, not definitions (except for templates and inline functions)

## Include Search Paths

When you use `#include <header>` or `#include "header"`, the compiler searches for headers in specific locations:

- `#include <header>`: System or compiler headers (standard library)
- `#include "header"`: Local project headers (your own files)

You can specify additional include paths with compiler flags:
```bash
g++ -I/path/to/includes main.cpp
```

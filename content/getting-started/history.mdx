# C++ Language History and Evolution

## Origins and Early Development

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs starting in 1979. Initially called "C with Classes," the language was renamed to C++ in 1983.

## Major Language Standards

### C++98/03
The first standardized version of C++ was published in 1998, with a minor update in 2003. Key features included:
- Templates
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Exception handling
- RTTI (Runtime Type Information)

### C++11
Released in 2011, this major update modernized the language with:
- Auto type inference
- Lambda expressions
- Smart pointers
- Range-based for loops
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- Threading library

### C++14
A minor update that improved C++11 features with:
- Generic lambdas
- Return type deduction for functions
- Improved constexpr

### C++17
Further modernized with:
- Structured bindings
- if and switch with initializers
- std::optional, std::variant, std::any
- Parallel algorithms
- File system library

### C++20
A significant update with:
- Concepts
- Ranges
- Coroutines
- Modules
- Three-way comparison (spaceship operator)

### C++23
Recent additions include:
- std::expected
- Improvements to modules
- Further refinements to ranges
- Additional standard library features

## Evolution Philosophy

C++ has evolved with a commitment to backward compatibility while adding modern features. The language committee follows these principles:
- Don't break existing code
- Provide zero-overhead abstractions
- Support systems programming
- Enable more expressive and safer code
